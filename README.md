# Half-Life Engine JS

A JavaScript module to load Half Life mods in the browser.

This repository is based on [Xash3D](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs) a game engine aiming to provide compatibility with Half-Life Engine.

It ic currently based on an old JavaScript port [(Xash3D-Emscripten)](https://github.com/iCrazyBlaze/Xash3D-Emscripten). The goal is to rebase it on a newer WebAssembly build of [Xash3D](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs).
